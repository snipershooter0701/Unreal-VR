## Rewrite Todolist

- [ ] Switch to OpenXR
    - [x] Use OpenXR
    - [x] Hook swapchain creation
    - [x] Set up UML for loader DLL
    - [x] Projection view matrix, switch eye locations
    - [ ] Revert namespace refactorings, use classes instead
    - [ ] Hook present
    - [ ] Get rid of UML mod, only use loader DLL
- [ ] Head tracking
	- [ ] Get input from OpenXR
	- [ ] Projection view matrix transformations on present
- [ ] GUI for editing options/launching games
	- WinUI3? Looks much nicer than Win32Forms or UWP
- [ ] Allow remapping actions to VR controllers
	- [ ] Get input from OpenXR
	- [ ] Forward button presses/movement to game
		- If player is looking to the side, rotate joystick input so that a forward press goes in head direction
- [ ] Allow scaling world vs. virtual space
	- [ ] Scale projection view matrix by custom scalar
	- [ ] Sync with present
- [ ] Synchronized eye rendering
	- [ ] Hook D3D11 get device context, return a deferred context that is recording
	- [ ] Play back the recording on UnrealVR's immediate context (x2, once for each eye)
	- [ ] Reset deferred context recording
- [ ] Customizable motion controls in certain games
	- [ ] Katana slash in Ghostrunner
		- No clue how this will work
